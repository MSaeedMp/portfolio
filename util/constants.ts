  description:
    "I am a **software/full-stack developer** with a background in **AI**, **digitalization**, and **web development**, specializing in building intelligent and scalable applications. I earned my **Dr.-Ing./Ph.D. in Engineering** from the **Technical University of Munich (TUM)** and spent four years as a research assistant and postdoctoral researcher. During this time, I worked on cutting-edge projects focused on bringing automation and AI-based solutions to the construction environment. \n\n My expertise extends from frontend to backend development. On the frontend, I specialize in **React**, **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **TypeScript** to create seamless and scalable user interfaces. For backend development, I utilize **MongoDB**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Prisma** to design efficient and well-structured databases. My workflow is enhanced with **Docker**, **Git**, and **CI/CD pipelines**, ensuring smooth deployment and maintainability of applications. \n\n  I am currently focused on developing **digital solutions** that streamline workflows, optimize processes, and enhance decision-making in complex industries. I am highly interested in creating **web applications** that are partially or heavyliy supported by **AI**. I am skilled in utilizing the following technologies:",
